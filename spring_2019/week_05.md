## Last Week's Accomplishments

I plan to learn the rest of JS in the next week, b ut I am not sure whether can I finish it or not


## Anything Blocking?

It is a little bit difficult to learn it at the beginning, but seems easier to me now
So far, I think there are some difficulties when learning these new things, but I solved most of the questions by Google
