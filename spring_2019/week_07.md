## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

For the last week, I learned almost all the rest of the Javascript material, like how to debug for it and loops. 
It is so boring for the debuging process as I always have some bug hard to find out.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

For the next week, I will see the code written before and discuss with my teammates about things we are going to improve on the webpage.


## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

I think things I learn now are boring but worth it. It is hard to debug my code because it takes a long time to figure out, but I will definitely solve it eventually.

## Notes
