## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

For the last week, I learned some stuff in Javascript, and also I tried to modify the webpage of schedule(previous was several pdfs). I want to change it to people can choose where and when want to be picked up, but I haven't finished yet.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

For the next week, I will continue do my work that haven't finished.


## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

It is a slow process, and I wrote many bad code which cannot run. I have tried thousands of times and failed. I think I should go back and solidate my basic knowledge better.
