## Last Week's Accomplishments

For the past four weeks, I asked my teammates what I need to learn before starting the project and I learned how to use 
Go, HTML, and CSS. I have learned basic concept,and how to understand it for the last week, and I believe it won't be long before I start working on project

For the next week, I will review the code written before and try to have a better understanding of the shuttle 
tracker project. Besides, I will continue learning HTML and css for futher study.

So far, I think there are some difficulties when learning these new things, but I solved most of the questions by Google
