## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.


For the last week, I learned the rest part of the go language. It turns out to be pretty good as I can almost write in this
language. Also, I learned some basic html and css. It is very hard for me because as I almost have no idea what they are talking 
about. I was having  a hard time but I am sure that I can figure it out.

> learned how to send requests in JavaScript to the backend API.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

For the next week, I will learn more about basic HTML and css for further study. I am trying to learn as much as I can 
because I really want to start working on project.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

I do not think there are some blocks for me right now. For most problems, I can solve it by myself. If I do not understand some problems, I will turn to my teammates.
