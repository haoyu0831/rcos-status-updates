## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

For the last week, I learned more of the Javascript material. I learned mostly about boolean logic and loops. Also when learning Javascript,
I looked at code written in Shuttle Tracker before, but I can hardly understand some and it seems so difficult for me to write about it.


## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

For the next week, I will continue learning Javascipt and hope I can finish learning and work on project.


## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

It is very hard for me to learn because it  seems totally different from what I learned in CS1 or data structure class.
So far, I think there are some difficulties when learning these new things, and mentors helped me solved most of them
