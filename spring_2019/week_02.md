## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.


For the last week, I learned go language, especially with how to write function, list, arrays, and so on. I learned it by google the difference between go, c++, and python. I think it is a little bit difficult to me as this is an entire new language. It turns out to be pretty good as I can write some basic functions using go with no problem.


> This past week, I was able to implement the the dialog box for creating a new user in the front end. I \
> learned how to send requests in JavaScript to the backend API.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

For the next week, I will learn some basic HTML and css for further study. They are for websites. As I am working on front-end design for shuttle tracker this semester, I should understand these basic knowledges.

> After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to add accessibility features to the user creation dialog box. \
> I also plan on attending the git workshop this week.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

I do not think there is some blocks for me right now. For most problems, I can solve it by myself. If I do not understand some problems, I will turn to my teammates.

> I don't know how to test the accessibility features I am going to be implementing this week, so i am going to \
> ask my mentors if they have any suggestions.
